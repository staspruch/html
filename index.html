<h2>Hello, my name is Stas Pruchansky and I am a BEERGEEK :)</h2>
<h2>What's a Beergeek?</h2>
<p class="my-purple-text">A "beergeek" is a term used to describe someone who is passionate about beer, particularly in terms of its production, history, styles, tasting, and culture. 
Beergeeks often have a deep knowledge of different beer varieties, brewing techniques, and the craft beer industry. 
They may enjoy exploring various breweries, attending beer festivals, and discussing beer-related topics with others who share their enthusiasm. 
Beergeeks are not just consumers of beer but also enthusiasts who appreciate the craftsmanship and complexity behind brewing.
